Hello Wordle users, here is script to show a small detailed analysis to your Wordle plays.

Simply add your scores to 'wordle.csv' seperating your numbers by commas
As an example you can type 
5,5,6,3,2,1,4,3,6,
While conventional games only go to 6 in terms of guesses, I have allowed for numbers above 6 and below 0 to be added to allow experimentation.

info.csv is used for added information, first line is just for the start date.
The format for this is YYYYMMDD so for the 2nd of March 2020. . You would have 20200302
The second line is for all dates that aren't played, they count towards skip days, same YYYYMMDD format as the above line. All seperated by commas
an example of this would be 20200302,20200305,20200308,
Chronological order is not mandatory as it will be sorted within the script.
The third lins is just for name input.

My score has been added in just as an example, please feel free to remove my scores and add your own.
A PDF will be made once the program has finished running.
If there are any errors in the input, a small error message will come up.

Finish time 23:42 18/02/2022

My name is Anwar Louis.
Have fun.
